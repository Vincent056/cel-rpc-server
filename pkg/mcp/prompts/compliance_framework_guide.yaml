  # TODO: {{ .framework | upper }} Compliance Implementation Guide
  
  This prompt is under development. For now, please:
  
  1. Use the `rule_creation_guide` prompt for general rule creation guidance
  2. Use the `cel_expression_help` prompt for CEL syntax help
  3. Use `list_rules` and `get_rule` tools to explore existing compliance rules
  4. Refer to the CEL examples resource for step-by-step patterns
  
  ## Placeholder Content
  
  Future implementation will include:
  - Framework-specific control mappings
  - Compliance-focused CEL patterns
  - Control-to-rule mapping guidance
  - Evidence collection requirements
  - Audit trail documentation
  
  ## Current Workflow
  
  For compliance rule creation, follow these steps:
  1. Use `list_rules category=compliance` to see existing compliance rules
  2. Use `get_rule` to study specific compliance rule implementations
  3. Use `rule_creation_guide` prompt with compliance context
  4. Use `cel_expression_help` for technical implementation
  5. Create rule with proper compliance metadata using `add_rule`
